# DataMatrix-Reader
I am currently exploring different options for reading in and decoding data matrices from JPG\PNG images for the Florida Museum of Natural History at UF. Until I have something more concrete, this will serve as a testing repository.

### Progress Notes
Python: the python script utilizes piping to simply call the dmtx-utils commandline tools. This is effective, yet it's kind of a cheeky solution. Might explore the python wrappers, although from what I've already explored it can be rather slow when compared to the command line program

C++: No testing yet. I plan on studying the dmtx-utils command line tools to create my own reader programs

Java: No testing yet.
